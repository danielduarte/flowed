## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/danielduarte/flowed/issues/new) and briefly describe what you are experimenting.

I will take care of it as soon as possible, and put any update on that issue.
Even if the issue is declined, corresponding explanation will be provided for you to know or discuss.

Reporting is a great contribution.
Thanks in advance!
